   - **Hilt** is the choice of DI Framework
   - Both **Unit** and **Instrumentation** tests are provided

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Kotlin coroutines are a feature used for simplifying asynchronous programming and concurrent tasks, offering structured, readable, and efficient code..
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) = Android UI toolkit that simplifies and accelerates the development of native Android user interfaces with a declarative and modern approach.

**`Troubleshooting:`** The most common reason for build failure when importing a new project is due to
  improper java version set in the IDE. If build fails, make sure you have the proper version of java set.

   - Go to `File`-> `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployement` -> `Build Tools`-> `Gradle`

   - This project was tested with`Jbr-11` and `jbr-17` setting `Gradle JDK` to any of them should resolve build issues.
